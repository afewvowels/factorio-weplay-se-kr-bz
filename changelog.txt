Version: 1.0.16
Date: 2023.10.14
  Major Features:
    - I figured out how changelogs worked!
  Features:
    - I forgot to adjust the Portable Roboport Equipment recipe requirement like I said I did in the last changelog. I did it this time. (Thanks Github Copilot and/or tabnine for that autocomplete lol)
  Coming Next:
    - Tier 0 Modules available from the start. I'll take the base game module graphic and either adjust the tint or something similarly minor and introduce it as a craftable item for the burner phase of the game since SE introduces all these new module graphics.
    - Tier 0 Roboport or robots. Probably inspired heavily by IR3's clockwork or steambots. Hopefully I can find something and throw it into Blender and rotate it and make a sprite sheet since I think they're pretty simple (as compared to trains and other things that have lights and parts that move or are animated separately).
